            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Great Kings remember you are ſubject to many more Miſeries, then you have ſubjects in your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Great Monarchs remember</hi> that of all the great extention of your <hi>Territories</hi> there ſhall not remain you one onely foot,<note place="margin">If we be different in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, we are all equall in neceſſity of dying.</note> ſo jealous are the worms of your glory. <hi>Great Princes remember</hi> that your Scepters and your Crowns, are ſuch feeble <hi>marks</hi> of greatneſſe, that fortune ſports with them, Time mocks at them, and the Wind ſhall ſweep away their Duſt: Soveraign Judges <hi>of the Life of Men, remember</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you are above the Lawes, <hi>This</hi> of Dying is inviolable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> is pretty, of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56236:28"/>which the flowers and plants took to elect a King and Queen,<note place="margin">Cares and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieties ſurpaſs in number the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Kings.</note> and as the number of Voyces gave the election, the <hi>Marigold</hi> was declared to be the King of the Flowers, and the <hi>Bryar</hi> Queen of Plants, and under this toy lies hid ſerious verities.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing fairer in all the borders of the Garden of Nature, then the flower of the <hi>Marigold?</hi> Its golden Tincture of the colour of the Sun, at firſt view dazeleth ſo delightfully; that the Eye amazedly gazing with admiration of its freſh-diſplayed beauty, can hardly retire its regards from an object ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. But gather it, and dight it on you, and its ſent produces a thouſand diſliks in the Mind, for that one onely, which you hold in your hand, for hence of a ſudda in the humours become dull, and melancholly having been annoyed with ſo fair a fulſomneſſe.<note place="margin">If Crowns &amp;: Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were to be ſould, wiſe men would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver buy thew.</note>

               <p>Royalty is abſolutely the ſame: The Scepters are as freſh flowers of <hi>Marigold,</hi> whoſe luſtre and beauty equally raviſhing, attract at firſt

If you doubt of this, aske <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he will anſwer, That the firſt moment of his Raigne, was the laſt of his Quietneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Sweet-bryar alſo bore away the Royalty; for who would not love it with its Roſe? O how both together have powerfull attractives, to tempt aqually, both the heart to deſire them, and the hand to pluck them? And 'tis in vain that Nature hath given arms to the jealouſie of its prickles,<note place="margin">Thorns are the Roſes of Kings gardens.</note> to ſerve for the defence of its flowers: ſince theſe ſharps are as ſo many baits, which irritate us rather with <hi>Deſire</hi> then <hi>Fear.</hi> All the world inſert it in their noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayes; but the prickles remain, the Roſe withers.</p>
               <p>Say we then alſo, that Royalty is a fair Sweet-bryar, accompanied with its Roſes; I mean many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of the ſame nature. Both together have great charms to affect

And is not this an object of pity, rather then of envy? Great Kings, theſe are truths too important for you, to loſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
               <p>Well you may out-brave the heavens with a birſtling eye-brow: the onely imagination of its Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps holds you already in alarm.

               <p>
                  <hi>Great Kings,</hi> Remember then, that you are not <hi>Great,</hi> but in miſerie, Soveraign <hi>Monarchs, Remember, that</hi> your Empiredome is but a ſervitude, ſince you are ſubject to all the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of your ſubjects.

               <p>How ingenious are the Poets in their fancies? They recount us, how that Inconſtancy being baniſht from heaven, deſcended upon earth, with deſign to have her picture drawn, and upon the reſuſe, that Painters made of it, ſhe addreſt her ſelfe to Time,<note place="margin">Man ſerves for a ſheuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke to all things, ſime all things concur to his ruine.</note> who after he had conſidered her in all her diverſities made uſe at laſt of the viſage of Man for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing cloath, wherein having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented her to the life, all the world took her for Man himſelf, ſince in effect 'tis but one and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56236:31"/>ſame thing. O fair truth diſcovered by a fable.<note place="margin">Man is Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy it ſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than its pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He then that now would ſee the Image of Inconſtancy, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Life-touches and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it; upon his own viſage. Our fore-head which wrinkles every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is it not the very ſame as hers? Our eies, which by continuall uſe every hour, do already require ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, are they not as hers? Our cheeks which now chap-fall are in nothing different from hers. In fine our viſages are the only <hi>MIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROURS WHICH FLAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER NOT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ſhall we anſwer notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the objection of this truth, that,<note place="margin">Though a Man hides himſelf under the vayle of hypocriſie his defects alwaies breake through.</note> that which we ſee of <hi>MAN,</hi> is not the <hi>MAN.</hi> If his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage like a falſe Horologe index falſe, this our pourtraict of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is meerly imaginary:</p>
               <p>But is there any thing more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant than the ſpirit of man? 'tis a weather-cock for all winds, behold again the firſt draughts of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Inconſtancy: muſt we not of neceſſity compare his changing

In fine, his thoughts, his deſires, and all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions of his mind, are but objects of viciſſitude, capable of all ſorts of impreſſions: ſo that in the perfection of the portraicture of man, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is found perfectly depainted. Let us proceed.</p>
               <p>The fictions of Poets are yet ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough,<note place="margin">Vertue onely can render us invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56236:32"/>are divine, but ſomething within poiles all, each particular is a heel, by which Death may ſurprize you.</p>
               <p>Shall I ſay then that you are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles's,</hi> who will believe me, ſince your heads ſerve but as Buts to the hafes of Fortune?<note place="margin">It is onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a juſt Man is of proofe, againſt the stroak of Time and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note> To preach you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable, a ſmall ſcratch may thereon give me the lye.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56236:76"/>love proceeds from the paſſion of our intereſt, ſeeking with much care and pain, all that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our contentments; and whereas Riches ſeem to be Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them, this conſequence is incident to be drawn, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them is no contented living. But at firſt daſh,<note place="margin">When <hi>Reaſon</hi> reigns, the paſſions obey.</note> it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh this love into Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Brutall, and believe, that with the illumination of reaſon, we may purifie the reliſhes of the firſt, even to the point of rendring them innocent, without depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our intereſts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the enjoyment of our pleaſures, giving them for object, the eſtabliſhment of our ſetled content, in miſpriſion of all thoſe things of the world, which may deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>As for this brutiſh <hi>Love,</hi> which eſtranging us from God, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us alſo from our ſelves; the paſſion of it becomes ſo ſtrong by our weakneſſe, that without a ſpeciall grace we grow old in this malady of Spirit of contenting
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56236:77"/>our Senſes, rather then obeying our Reaſon, making a new God of the Treaſures of the Earth. But in concluſion, theſe Gods abandon our bodies to the Worms, and our ſouls to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. And for all their <hi>riches,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Great ones</hi> can onely purchaſe a glorious Sepulture. <hi>Is</hi> not this a great advantage, and a goodly conſolation?</p>

A man, how miſerable ſomever, may find his contentment amidſt his miſeries, if he lives for his ſoul more then for his bodies behalf. God makes us to be born where he will, and of what Parents he pleaſes: if the poorneſs of our birth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56236:77"/>accompany us even to death, he hath ſo ordained it; what can elſe do but let him ſo do? Can he be accounted miſerable, that obey's with good grace his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns decrees?</p>

               <p>O How glorious is the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over <hi>Death?</hi> O how brave is the <hi>Vistory</hi> over a Mans life! You ſee how this great<note n="*" place="margin">Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> 
                  <hi>Monarch</hi> triumphs to day over that proud Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Death,</hi> after the happy van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhment of his paſſions. He enters into his <hi>Empire</hi> by the Port of his <hi>Tomb,</hi> thus to raign du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, like a man that dies every moment; he celebrates himſelf his own <hi>Funerals,</hi> and is led in Triumph to his <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> to learn to die generouſly. What a glory's this to over-awe <hi>That,</hi> which commands the whole
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56236:87"/>world? what Courage is this, to aſſail and combate <hi>That,</hi> which none could ever yet reſiſt? and what a power is it to tame <hi>That</hi> which never yet yielded? <hi>Echo</hi> her ſelf hath not rebounds enow to reſound aloud the wonders of this <hi>Victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he made his entry into <hi>Babylon,</hi> mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Chariot as rich as the <hi>Indies,</hi> and more gliſtering then the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this we ſee no other riches, but the rich contempt, which ought to be made of them; no other luſtre, but of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Caeſar</hi> then, when be was drawn unto the <hi>Capitoll</hi> by forty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, after he had won twenty four battels. In this we ſee nought elſe but a <hi>funerall</hi> pomp, but yet ſo glorious, that <hi>Death</hi> her ſelf ſerves for a <hi>Trophy</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> where the glorious luſtre of the magnificence ſham'd the ſplendour of the day, which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56236:88"/>yet lent its light to it. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels which appear'd in this here, ſeem'd as celebrating in black the Exequies of all the other braveries of the world, ſince nothing can be ſeen more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then this.</p>
               <p>This is not the Triumph of <hi>Aurelian</hi> where all the graces are led captive with <hi>Zenobia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>vice,</hi> is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest <hi>Trophie.</hi>
                  </note> In this are to be ſeen no other captives but the world, and all its vanities, and their defeat is the richeſt Crown of the <hi>Victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not the Triumph of that pompous Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> entring into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where ſhe rayſ'd admiration to her ſelf in a Galley of unutrerable value, but in this we contemplate the more then human induſtry of a Pilote, who from the mid'ſt of the ſtorms and tempeſt of the world, recovers happily to the Port, the ſhip of his life, though yet but in the way to approach to it.</p>
               <p>In fine, this is not the Triumph of <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> whoſe ſtately Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56236:88"/>four Kings drew. Paſſions are the onely ſlaves of this, and <hi>Death</hi> being here vanquiſht, this honour remains immortall, and the name of the Triumpher.</p>
               <p>Say we then once again,<note place="margin">All the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>men</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them.</note> O how glorious a Triumph is this, over <hi>Death! O how brave is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over our ſelves!</hi> and the onely means thus to vanquiſh a mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is to bury his <hi>ambition</hi> before his body be <hi>enſepulchred,</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nevertheleſſe the tomb of both; to the end, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall remembrances of <hi>Death,</hi> may ſerve for temperament and moderation to the delights of life.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> that returning to <hi>Rome</hi> laden with wreaths of Laurell, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victory over the <hi>Perſians;</hi> he made his entrance of triumph with ſo great pomp and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, that the Sun ſeemed to rouz it ſelf many times, as if upon deſign to contemplate theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompy</hi> deſirous to expoſe to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56236:89"/>view of day, all the magnificent preſents, which Fortune had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in his laſt conqueſts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred now the third time in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the noiſe of his valour made as many Idolaters, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, gaining hearts, and now conquering ſoules, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Realms and Provinces: But it ſeems, that the glory, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him in this action had this defect, not to be ſufficiently worthily known, even of thoſe that were witneſles of it, as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing by much, all that they could poſſibly expreſſe of it.</p>
               <p>There was ſeen advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his charriot,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vanitie!</hi> is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> it flatters, onely to ſurprize.</note> in oſtentation, a Checker-worke compoſed of two ſorts of precious ſtones, whoſe beauty ſet them beyond all price: But yet (me thinks) their ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling might have in good time been a light to him, if by a feeling of fore-ſight, touching the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of his fortune, he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been graven thereon the hiſtory of his miſhaps. There
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56236:89"/>was admired in ſequell; a <hi>Statue</hi> of the Moon, all of Gold, in form of a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> and I am aſtoniſht, that this Image of change and <hi>Viciſſitude,</hi> made him not foreſee the deturning of the Wheele, I mean the ſtorme, that was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the calme of his happineſſe. He cauſed moreover to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him a great number of Veſſels of Gold, never thinking that <hi>Death</hi> might ſoon repleniſh ſome part of them with his aſhes. There was ſeen to follow a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all of Gold, upon which were all ſorts of animals, and many Trees of the ſame matter, and this mountaine was enrounded with a Vine, whoſe golden glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering dazled the eies of all that conſidered its wonders. This proud Triumpher was the <hi>Orpheus</hi> which to the <hi>Lyrick</hi> ſound of his renown,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is an incurable diſeaſe of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> if in good time it be nor lookt too.</note> attracted this mountaine, theſe Animals, theſe Trees, this Vine. But as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> ſo him alſo, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune deſtinated a <hi>Prey</hi> to the fury of <hi>Bacchinals,</hi> I mean the Eunuchs which put him to <hi>Death.</hi> Three
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56236:90"/>Statues of gold, firſt <hi>Jupiters,</hi> then <hi>Mars,</hi> and then of <hi>Pallas,</hi> came after. Theſe were his Gods and his Goddeſſe: what ſuccours could he expect from theſe Deities, which had no ſubſiſtence, but in ſtatue, and the copy of whoſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict had no principall? There was had in admiration moreover, thirty garlands all of gold,<note place="margin">A man had need to have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, not to forget himſelfe among his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> and Pearles: but theſe Crownes were too weighty for his head, from whence it came to paſſe, that he tell under the burden. A golden Chappell followed after, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Muſes,</hi> upon which was a great Horologe of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials. And as the Index ſtill tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ought not he to have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the houre of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing began to paſſe away, and that of his overthrow would preſently ſound, being ſequell to the Lawes of that viciſſitude, to which Face hath ſubjected all things? His ſtatue of gold enricht with diamonds, and pearls where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nor he himſelfe, nor he that enwrought them, knew the value
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56236:90"/>followed in its courſe, and in fine, this his ſhadow, was more happy than the true body, as having never been ſcuffled with, but by time, and the other was vanquiſht with miſerie.

               </p>
               <p>The Paſſion of <hi>Envy</hi> as black as hell, and the moſt criminal of all together proceeds from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed miſchievouſneſs, to which nature contributes nothing at all.

What means is there then to vanquiſh this untameable vice? No other but this, to conſider the Juſtice of that <hi>adorable Providence</hi> which imparts never its favours and graces, but with weight and meaſure. <hi>God cannot do but juſtly, ſince his Juſtice is no other then himſelf.</hi> Then if this man have 10000 pounds a year, and I but a 100, whereof can I complain? ſhall I doubt the reaſon from Reaſon it ſelf? ſhall I accuſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56236:115"/>Juſtice of injuſtice? To take for granted that the Soveraign of all does what he will, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty what he pleaſeth, I will alwayes relye to that ballance which God bears in his hand, and by which himſelf weigheth his actions to the poize of his will, and conſequently to the meaſure of his Juſtice. What objection can be made againſt this truth?</p>
               <p>Envious <hi>Maligner,</hi>

Behold the Corollary of my firſt Argument, or Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond</hi> inſtructs us a new means, to reſiſt powerfully the <hi>hits</hi> of the <hi>vanities</hi> of the world, from the example of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes of<note n="*" place="margin">Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae.</note> 
                  <hi>of one of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> of the world. <hi>Fortune</hi> had refuſed him nothing, becauſe ſhe meant to take all from him,<note place="margin">Poverty and Riches depend upon opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a noble ſoul is above his fortune in what condition ſoever he be.</note> for in the height of his glory he finds himſelf reduced to the poorneſſe of his <hi>ſhirt</hi> onely, which is all he carries with him into the <hi>grave.</hi> And this makes us ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the greatneſſes of the earth are <hi>Goods,</hi> as good as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from human nature,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56236:139"/>ſince in this mortall and periſhing condition we can onely poſſeſſe their uſance, and the <hi>term</hi> of this <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> is of ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> endurance that we ſee as ſoon the <hi>end</hi> as the <hi>beginning. Reader repreſent unto thy ſelf, how thou ſhalt be dealt with at thy death, both by Fortune and the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Et quae veneraris, &amp; quae deſpicis unus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequabit cinis. <hi>Sen.</hi>

               <p>The Third Chapter, where <hi>Life</hi> leads <hi>Death</hi> in Triumph teaches us the Art to vanquiſh <hi>this untamable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Death, is purely in the we ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> by conſidering its weakneſſe: for in effect, if Death be but a privation, 'tis to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of reaſon and judgement, to give it a being, ſince it cannot ſubſiſt but in our impaired ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. The fantaſme of an <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>it,</hi> whoſe very form is immateriall, as having no other ſubſiſtence, I ſay but that which the weakneſſe of our ſpirit gives
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56236:139"/>it. And again, to come to the moſt <hi>important point;</hi> Let this be <hi>the cloſe</hi> of the <hi>recapitulation,</hi>
